Slack notification sending resource
===================================

Sends messages to [Slack](https://slack.com).

Source Configuration
--------------------

-	`url`: *Required.* The webhook URL as provided by Slack. Usually in the form: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXX`

Behavior
--------

### `out`: Sends message to Slack.

Send message to Slack, with the configured parameters.

#### Parameters

Required:

Either of the following parameters are required:

-	`text`: Static text of the message to send.
-	`text_file`: File that contains the message to send. This allows the message to be generated by a previous task step in the Concourse job.

The text can contain links in form `<http://example.com>` or `<http://example.com|Click here!>`.

Optional:

-	`channel`: *Optional.* Override channel to send message to. `#channel` and `@user` forms are allowed.
-	`username`: *Optional.* Override name of the sender of the message.
-	`icon_url`: *Optional.* Override icon by providing URL to the image.
-	`icon_emoji`: *Optional.* Override icon by providing emoji code (e.g. `:ghost:`).

Examples
--------

If you're interested in the API of Concourse resources and/or contributing to this resource, you can play with the `out` script using examples. There are some available in the `examples` folder.

Note: they have a `params.debug` set so that it only prints out the data structures rather than attempting to invoke the Slack API. Remove it and set a real Slack API to test the script against Slack.

```
$ cat examples/text.out | ./out
webhook_url https://some.url
body {"text":"Inline static text","username":"concourse","icon_url":null,"icon_emoji":null,"channel":null}

$ cat examples/text_file.out | ./out
webhook_url https://some.url
body {"text":"This text came from sample.txt. It could have been generated by a previous Concourse task.","username":"concourse","icon_url":null,"icon_emoji":null,"channel":null}
```
